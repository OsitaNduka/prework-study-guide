## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide as a bootcamp student when I was going through the Prework.
The study guide contains the subjects I learned in the prework excercise.
It includes notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript.
I learned using this codes to give instructions to computer. I also learned abstract thinking and problem-solving such as debugging a code.
I used the prework study guide to structure my prework study notes so that I can easily find and read the informations.
This was deployed using GitHub pages so that I can share it with anyone who can visit it on the internet, World Wide Web (www) using a unique address know as Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

In the Chrome DevTools  by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), a console would open, we can see the Javascript running, showing us the lists of topics I learned from prework and an option of one topic for me to study first.
